5/1/2015:
* Fix bootloader tiny1634 maximum size spec. 
* Add 12mhz bootloader for tiny1634
* Add noLED bootloaders for 841

4/22/2015:
* Go full 1.6.x, now you can just sync github to hardware in sketchbook and modify avrdude.conf. 1.0.6 setup is documented.
* Add Tiny1634 support (based on rambo's core)

4/1/2015:
* Add platform_162.txt for people using 1.6.2

3/16/2015:
* Add copy of 1.6.0 libraries for 1.6.0 users. 

3/15/2015:
* Update boards.txt - there are now two entries for the optiboot boards as a hopefully temporary solution to changes in how bootloader .hex file location is specified. For non-optiboot, it doesn't matter, since 1.0.6 would just fail to write the flash which we're not writing anyway.
* Update pins_arduino.h to define SPI pins.
* Remove bogus programmer entries from boards.txt

3/14/2015:
* Optiboot works.
* Update readme.
